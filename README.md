## 🚀 About Me
## I embarked on my development journey at the age of 42 in 2019. Starting this path later in life has given me a unique perspective and a deep appreciation for the art and science of coding. I bring a wealth of life experience to my projects, and I'm constantly looking for new challenges that push the boundaries of my knowledge and skills.

### 💻 My Development Journey
#### A Late Bloomer in Tech: My journey into tech started in 2019, at the age of 42. This late start has only fueled my passion and determination to make up for lost time.
#### Passionate JavaScript Learner: JavaScript has captured my interest above all. I'm fascinated by its versatility and power in web development. I spend a significant amount of my time mastering this language, exploring its nuances, and creating dynamic, interactive web experiences.
#### Web Development & More: Besides JavaScript, I've been honing my skills in other areas of web development, including HTML, CSS, and PHP. I'm also proficient in WordPress, creating custom themes and plugins to enhance website functionality and user experience.
#### Continuous Learning: I'm a firm believer in lifelong learning. The tech field is ever-evolving, and staying current is crucial. I regularly update my skills through courses, tutorials, and hands-on projects.
### 🌐 Social Media
I believe in the power of community and networking. You can find me on Twitter and LinkedIn, where I hang out most of my time when it comes to social media. It's a great place to connect, share knowledge, and stay updated with the latest in tech. Also you can read articles related of [JavaScript](https://blog.accolades.dev/3-keys-in-javascript-arrays/) , [PHP](https://blog.accolades.dev/why-i-dropped-javascript-for-php/), Divi, and WordPress related [here](https://blog.accolades.dev/become-a-developer-at-40)
